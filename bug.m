In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to retain cycles.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If `MyClass` holds a strong reference to `AnotherClass`, and `AnotherClass` simultaneously holds a strong reference to `MyClass`, a retain cycle is formed.  Neither object can be deallocated, leading to memory leaks. This is particularly problematic in long-running applications.
